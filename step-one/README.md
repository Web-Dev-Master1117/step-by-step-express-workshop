# What have we done in this step

We installed Express (`npm i express`), and set up an extremely simple web server using Express in `app.js`. This web server will listen to port 8080, and are responding to a single route (`/`) with a simple message (`Hello from Express! ðŸ‘‹`). Finally, we let ourselves know the app is running by logging a tiny message out to the console.
