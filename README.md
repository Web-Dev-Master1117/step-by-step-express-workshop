# Step by Step Express

The intent of this project is to take you step-by-stepo through the process of building an Express app, documenting the changes as bite-sized chunks that you'll ideally be able to pick up and iterate upon rapidly.

## Step Zero

## Step Three

- Started parsing the querystring passed to the web app and – if the querystring `id` is present – passing that value to the API we're hitting, via the `request` module.

## Step Four

- Add view rendering with `handlebars` (via `express-handlebars`)
- Create our first view
- Start rendering comics with handlebars on the `/comic` path
